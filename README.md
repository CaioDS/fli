# fli

- **Version Management**: Install multiple Flutter versions and switch between them seamlessly.
- **NVM-like CLI**: Familiar workflow for anyone who has used Node Version Manager (NVM).
- **Platform Support**: Currently available for Windows. macOS support is planned for the future.

## Coming Soon

- **Extended Platform Support**: More platforms as demand grows.
